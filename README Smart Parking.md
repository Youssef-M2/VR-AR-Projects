# 🚗 Smart AR Parking Management System  
**IoT-Based Intelligent Parking with Augmented Reality**

## 🧠 Project Description

**Smart AR Parking Management System** is an intelligent IoT-based solution that combines **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **embedded systems** to optimize parking space management.

The system uses **IR sensors** to detect vehicle presence, an **ESP32 microcontroller** for processing and connectivity, **Blynk** for real-time monitoring, and an **AR interface** to visualize parking availability in an interactive way.

## 🧪 System Workflow

1. A vehicle approaches the parking entrance  
2. IR sensor detects the vehicle  
3. ESP32 processes the sensor data  
4. Servo motor opens or closes the gate  
5. Parking slot status is updated on Blynk  
6. Parking availability is visualized in AR
